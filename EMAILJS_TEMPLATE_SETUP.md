### 2. **Template Content**

Use this exact template content:

```

### 3. **Template Variables**

The template uses these variables:
- `{{to_email}}` - Recipient's email address
- `{{subject}}` - Email subject line
- `{{message}}` - Email message body

### 6. **Troubleshooting**

If emails aren't sending:

2. Verify the template name is exactly `template_default`
3. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
4. Ensure the user has a valid email address in their profile

### 7. **Email Templates Being Sent**

The system will automatically send these types of emails:

1. **Request Confirmation**: When a user submits an emergency request
